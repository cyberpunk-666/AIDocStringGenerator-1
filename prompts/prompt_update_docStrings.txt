I am requesting docstrings for specific Python functions and classes that currently lack documentation. The required docstrings should be generated based on the following verbosity scale, ranging from 0 to 5, where each level represents:

- 0: No comments or docstrings.
- 1: Very brief, one-line comments for major functions and classes only.
- 2: Concise but informative docstrings for classes and functions, covering basic purposes and functionality.
- 3: Detailed docstrings including parameters, return types, and a description of the function or class behavior.
- 4: Very detailed explanations, including usage examples in the docstrings.
- 5: Extremely detailed docstrings, providing in-depth explanations, usage examples, and covering edge cases.

The current verbosity level for this task is set to {verbosity_level}. This level should guide the detail and depth of the docstrings generated. The response should be structured as a JSON object with the 'docstrings' part, containing key-value pairs where each key is the name of a function or class without existing docstrings, and each value is the newly generated docstring consistent with the specified verbosity level.

Please adhere to the following JSON format for the response, ensuring the usage of simple double quotes for strings:

{
    "docstrings": {
        "ClassName":{"docstring": "ClassName1 description",
            "function1_name": "function1_name description",
            "function2_name": "function2_name description"
        }
        "ClassName2":{"docstring": "ClassName2 description",
            "function1_name": "function1_name description",
            "function2_name": "function2_name description"
        }

    }
}

Here is the Python code for which I need the docstrings, adhering to the verbosity level as per the configuration setting:

{source_code}

Note: Only generate docstrings for functions and classes that currently lack them. Ensure the response follows the specified format and reflects the appropriate level of detail as per the verbosity setting.
