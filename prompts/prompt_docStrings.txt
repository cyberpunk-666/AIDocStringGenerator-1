I'm requesting docstrings and code examples for specific Python code elements, with careful attention to global functions.

Key requirements:

Strict adherence to line length: Enforce a maximum line length of {max_line_length} characters for all text within the JSON response.

The level of detail in the docstrings should be adjustable based on a verbosity scale from 0 to 5, as follows:

Function and Class docstrings verbosity levels:
0: No docstrings for functions.
1: Very brief, one-line comments for major functions only.
2: Concise but informative docstrings for functions, covering basic purposes and functionality.
3: Detailed docstrings including parameters, return types, and a description of the function behavior.
4: Very detailed explanations, including usage examples in the docstrings.
5: Extremely detailed docstrings, providing in-depth explanations, usage examples, and covering edge cases.

Example verbosity levels:
0: No examples.
1: Simple examples demonstrating basic usage.
2: More comprehensive examples covering various use cases.
3: Detailed examples with step-by-step explanations.
4: Extensive examples including edge cases and error handling.
5: Interactive examples or code playgrounds for experimentation.

The current verbosity levels are set to:

Class docstrings: {class_docstrings_verbosity_level}
Function docstrings: {function_docstrings_verbosity_level}
Example: {example_verbosity_level}
Please use these levels to determine the appropriate level of detail in each section of the response.

JSON format: Adhere to the specified JSON response structure (see below).
Focus on undocumented elements: Only generate docstrings for those currently lacking them.
Specific attention to global functions: Ensure clear identification and documentation of functions not defined within classes.
JSON response format:

{
    "docstrings": {
        "ClassName": {
            "docstring": "Class description",
            "example": "Code example",
            "methods": {
                "function_name": "Function description"
            }
        },
        "global_functions": {
            "global_function_name": "Global function description"
        }
    }
}
Code:

{source_code}
Additional notes:

Double backslashes for line breaks: Use \\n for line breaks in examples and docstrings.
Verbosity levels: Guide the level of detail in docstrings and examples (see definitions above).
Example: Provide a code example for the main class or a key function.
Please carefully parse the code to accurately identify and document global functions, ensuring their proper placement within the â€śglobal_functionsâ€ť section of the JSON response.
