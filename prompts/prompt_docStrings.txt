I am requesting docstrings for specific Python functions and classes that currently lack documentation and a functional example for each classes in the following Python code, with an adjustable level of detail based on a verbosity scale from 0 to 5.
The meanings of each verbosity level are as follows:

- 0: No comments or docstrings.
- 1: Very brief, one-line comments for major functions and classes only.
- 2: Concise but informative docstrings for classes and functions, covering basic purposes and functionality.
- 3: Detailed docstrings including parameters, return types, and a description of the function or class behavior.
- 4: Very detailed explanations, including usage examples in the docstrings.
- 5: Extremely detailed docstrings, providing in-depth explanations, usage examples, and covering edge cases.

The current verbosity level for this task is set to {verbosity_level} and should be used to determine the level of detail in your explanations. Additionally, please provide a code example demonstrating the functionality of the main class or a key function in the code.

Please adhere to the following JSON format for the response, ensuring the usage of simple double quotes for strings:

{
    "docstrings": {
        "ClassName":{"docstring": "ClassName1 description",
            "function1_name": "function1_name description",
            "function2_name": "function2_name description"
        }
        "ClassName2":{"docstring": "ClassName2 description",
            "function1_name": "function1_name description",
            "function2_name": "function2_name description"
        }

    },
    "examples": {
        "example_ClassName": "variable = function_name()\\nprint(variable2)",
        "example_ClassName2": "variable = function_name2()\\naprint(variable2)"
    }

}


Here is the Python code for which I need the docstrings and functional example, adhering to the verbosity level as per the configuration setting:

{source_code}

Note: Only generate docstrings for functions and classes that currently lack them.
Ensure the response follows the specified format and reflects the appropriate level of detail as per the verbosity setting.
