### How to Use the Docstring Generator

#### Prerequisites

-   Python installed on your system.
-   Basic familiarity with Python programming.
-   Access to AI services like Claude or GPT-4


### Basic Setup and Configuration

1.  **Install the Package**: If the tool is available on PyPI, install it using pip:
    
    `pip install AIDocStringGenerator` 
    
2.  **Initial Configuration**:
    
    -   Locate and rename `config_template.json` to `config.json` in the installed package directory.

### 3. Configuration Parameters

-   **path:**  The file or directory path to process.
-   **wipe_docstrings:**  If  `true`, existing docstrings in files will be wiped before generating new ones.
-   **verbose:**  Enable verbose output if set to  `true`.
-   **bot:**  Specify the AI bot to use (options include  `gpt3.5`,  `gpt4`,  `gpt4-120k`,  `claude`,  `file`).
-   **bot_response_file:**  This parameter allows you to specify the base name of a single file that contains pre-defined responses, located in the "responses" folder. The tool reads and uses responses from this file and its sequentially numbered parts (if any), such as  `file_name.response.json`,  `file_name.response2.json`,  `file_name.response3.json`, etc. This setup is ideal for testing and debugging with predetermined, multi-part responses when direct interaction with an AI bot is not feasible.
-   **BARD_API_KEY`,`OPENAI_API_KEY`,`CLAUDE_API_KEY:**  API keys for the respective AI services.
-   **include_subfolders:**  Set to  `true`  to include subfolders in processing.
-   **class_docstrings_verbosity_level:**  Controls the level of detail in the generated docstrings for classes. Valid values are 0-5, with higher values indicating more detailed docstrings.
-   **function_docstrings_verbosity_level:**  Controls the level of detail in the generated docstrings for functions. Valid values are 0-5, with higher values indicating more detailed docstrings.
-   **example_verbosity_level:**  Controls the level of detail in the generated code examples. Valid values are 0-5, with higher values indicating more comprehensive and complex examples.
-   **keep_responses:**  If set to  `true`, the tool saves the bot responses in the "responses" folder.
-   **ignore:**  An array of strings containing file or directory names to exclude from processing.


4.  **Command Line Overrides**:
    
    -   Command line arguments allow you to override settings in `config.json`.
    -   Example command:
        
        `AIDocStringGenerator --path "/path/to/source" --verbose --wipe_docstrings --bot "claude" --include_subfolders --verbosity_level "5"` 
        
	**Verbosity Levels:**

	To control the level of detail in the generated docstrings and examples, you can use the following verbosity levels:

	**Function and Class Docstrings Verbosity Levels:**

	-   0: No docstrings for functions or classes.
	-   1: Very brief, one-line comments for major functions and classes only.
	-   2: Concise but informative docstrings, covering basic purposes and functionality.
	-   3: Detailed docstrings including parameters, return types, and a description of the behavior.
	-   4: Very detailed explanations, including usage examples in the docstrings.
	-   5: Extremely detailed docstrings, providing in-depth explanations, usage examples, and covering edge cases.

	**Example Verbosity Levels:**

	-   0: No examples.
	-   1: Simple examples demonstrating basic usage.
	-   2: More comprehensive examples covering various use cases.
	-   3: Detailed examples with step-by-step explanations.
	-   4: Extensive examples including edge cases and error handling.
	-   5: Interactive examples or code playgrounds for experimentation.


### Continuous Integration (CI) Setup

1.  **Use Command Line Parameters in CI**:
    
    -   In CI environments (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions), prefer command line parameters for configuration.
    -   This allows for dynamic adjustment of settings per CI run.
2.  **Secure API Keys with CI Secrets**:
    
    -   Store sensitive data like API keys as environment secrets in your CI system.
    -   Refer to these secrets in the command line arguments to ensure security.
3.  **Example CI Configuration** (for GitHub Actions):
    
```yaml
steps:
- name: Run AIDocStringGenerator
  run: |
    AIDocStringGenerator --path "$GITHUB_WORKSPACE/path/to/source" \
                         --verbose \
                         --wipe_docstrings \
                         --bot "claude" \
                         --include_subfolders \
                         --verbosity_level "5" \
                         --BARD_API_KEY ${{ secrets.BARD_API_KEY }} \
                         --OPENAI_API_KEY ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }} \
                         --CLAUDE_API_KEY ${{ secrets.CLAUDE_API_KEY }}
```  

 In this GitHub Actions example:    
    -   `$GITHUB_WORKSPACE` is an environment variable indicating the workspace directory.
    -   `secrets.BARD_API_KEY`, `secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY`, and `secrets.CLAUDE_API_KEY` are GitHub Actions secrets containing the API keys.
    
4.  **Setting Up Secrets in GitHub Actions**:
    
    -   Add API keys as secrets in the repository's Settings under 'Secrets'.
    -   Ensure the names of the secrets in GitHub match those used in the command.



# Running the Generator**

## Process Files or Directories

The AI Docstring Generator can process either a single Python file or an entire directory containing multiple files. You have two options for providing processing instructions:

### Using Command Line Arguments

To run the tool with command-line arguments, use the following format:

Bash

```
AIDocStringGenerator --path "/path/to/python/files" --verbose

```

content_copy

This command processes Python files located at the specified path, with verbose output enabled.

### Using a Configuration File

If you start the program without providing command-line arguments, it will automatically look for a configuration file named `config.json` in the current working directory. This file allows you to specify the processing parameters in a structured format.

## Example Configuration

Here's an example `config.json` file:

JSON

```
{
    "path": "tests/classTest.py",
    "bot": "file",
    "bot_response_file": "classTest",
    "include_subfolders": false,
    "wipe_docstrings": true,
    "verbose": true,
    "BARD_API_KEY": "",
    "OPENAI_API_KEY": "",
    "CLAUDE_API_KEY": "",
    "keep_responses": false,
    "ignore": [".venv"],
    "class_docstrings_verbosity_level": 5,
    "function_docstrings_verbosity_level": 2,
    "example_verbosity_level": 3
}

```
